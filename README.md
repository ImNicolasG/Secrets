# Secrets

This is an app that has a login and register page and allows you to use Facebook and Google Authentication. If the login is successful, it will display the page of secrets and allow the user to submit a secret of their own.
Uses Passport.js to hash/salt passwords for security for users that create a new account without using FB or Google Authentication.
This app was created as a project from The Complete 2022 Web Developement Bootcamp - Angela Yu
